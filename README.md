# Payroll-Tracker

## Description

This project was designed to collect user input of employee names/salary to turn into a readable table. This application is able to then sort through employee data, display the avaerage salary of all employees, and choose an employee at random to win a giveaway. Main components of building this application included understanding "while" loops, building arrays using JavaScript, and accessing that data at a later point.
